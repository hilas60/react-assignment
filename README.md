## Hunters - React Assignment

[www.flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com) is a known photo-sharing site. Flickr provides a well-documented API for exploring photos and other tasks.

Your goal in this exercise is to complete the React application that we will provide you, by completing the missing code, missing functionality, typescript, CSS, etc.. also you will face some bugs, let us see what you got ;)

use this public feed:
[https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne](https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne)

Your application should have the following features

-   A home page with all photos
-   Seatch box - should filter out only photos matching with the searching input
-   When clicking a photo, it should open a new page with the following information:
    - The photo
    - The title of the image
    - The author-name
    - Date taken
-   Clicking on the author’s name should reload the gallery with the author’s photos only

Notes **!important**
- Use the Flicker documentation
- No need for an API key
- Take into consideration the UI design and the usability of the page
- Using no react UI components / CSS framework
- Pay attention to your coding style and patterns
- Don't Build a server solution
- Don't use XML for crying out loud
- Implementing best practices, design patterns, and just cool stuff is more than welcome
- Masonry layout for the gallery is recommended
